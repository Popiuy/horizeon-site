## Description short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project?
this project is showcasing refactoring of html and css, i used correct semantic elements including article, aside, header, footer, and nav
this was done by double checking what line of code was affecting the webpage. I then used the corresponding lines of code to rewrite the divs to showcase the code with organization.
my motivation was to understand and apply semantic elements to a webpage. I build this project to give me a better idea of how html and css can be refactored to make more sense.

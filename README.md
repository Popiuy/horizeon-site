## Description 
This project is showcasing refactoring of html and css, I used correct semantic elements including article, aside, header, footer, and nav.
This was done by double checking what line of code was affecting the webpage. I then used the corresponding lines of code to rewrite the divs to showcase the code with organization.
I made the title of the webpage concise and more applicable.
I added alt attributes to my pictures to add context.
My motivation was to understand and apply semantic elements to a webpage. I build this project to give me a better idea of how html and css can be refactored to make more sense.
